# similarity-modeling
Repository for the "Similarity modeling" 1 &amp; 2 courses at the TU Wien.


## Requirements
You need an environment with Python 3.10 installed (e.g. using conda, `conda create -n simmod python==3.10`). Then, you can install the requirements with:
```
$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

## Understanding our work
The repository is generally organized in three folders:
- `utils`: contains the code used for multiple experiments, such as the data processing and handling. 
- `sim1`: contains our work for the Similarity Modeling 1 assignment. The work is in the form of Jupyter Notebooks that can be run to reproduce our results. **The reasoning for our decisions, our process and our results are discussed in the notebooks** (separate notebooks for Audio-, Vision- and hybrid-based approaches).
- `sim2`: contains our work for the Similarity Modeling 2 assignment. The work is in the form of Jupyter Notebooks that can be run to reproduce our results. **The reasoning for our decisions, our process and our results are discussed in the notebooks** (separate notebooks for Audio-, Vision- and hybrid-based approaches).
