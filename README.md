# similarity-modeling
Repository for the "Similarity modeling" 1 &amp; 2 courses at the TU Wien.


## Requirements
You need an environment with Python 3.10 installed (e.g. using conda, `conda create -n simmod python==3.10`). Then, you can install the requirements with:
```
$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

## Understanding our work
The repository is generally organized in three folders:
- `utils`: contains the code used for multiple experiments, such as the data processing and handling. 
- `sim1`: contains our work for the Similarity Modeling 1 assignment. The work is in the form of Jupyter Notebooks that can be run to reproduce our results. **The reasoning for our decisions, our process and our results are discussed in the notebooks** (separate notebooks for Audio-, Vision- and hybrid-based approaches).
- `sim2`: contains our work for the Similarity Modeling 2 assignment. The work is in the form of Jupyter Notebooks that can be run to reproduce our results. **The reasoning for our decisions, our process and our results are discussed in the notebooks** (separate notebooks for Audio-, Vision- and hybrid-based approaches). 


## Timesheet for the lectures and summaries
Timesheets for the work on the project are present in the different notebooks. The following tables are dedicated to the time spent on watching the lectures and writing the summaries.
