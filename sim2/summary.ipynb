    "For or work organization, as both of us work on both Similarity Modeling 1 and 2, we decided to split the work on each course by modality. For example, for Similarity Modeling 1, Alina would work on visual features and Daniel on audio features, and we would sit down together to combine them in a hybrid classifier as well afterwards. To ensure that we both work thoroughly on each modality, the person who did audio on one course did visual on the other one (Daniel on SM1 audio and SM2 visual, Alina on SM1 visual and SM2 audio).  \n",
    "Before starting that work, we also sat down together to brainstorm and decide on our general approaches: we looked through the data and discussed what kind of aspects are representative of each character and how we could extract them. Based on this, we decided on the feature extractors and classifiers we would want to try to ensure that we use different ones.\n",

    "For our experiments, a generic data handling class has been implemented (`MuppetDataset.py`) where audio and image extraction, as well as loading, is abstracted. This class is then used in the respective notebooks for the experiments, where feature extraction methods have then been applied on the data contained by the class to generate tabular-form data that also contains the provided ground truth. That tabular data has been used in the specific classifiers, as well as exported and merged for the hybrid classifier.The approaches, experiments and results for each modality are described in the respective sections here, and even more in detail in their notebooks.\n"
